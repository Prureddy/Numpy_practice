## NumPy Getting Started

This section covers the basics of getting started with NumPy. It provides an introduction to NumPy, including installation instructions and basic usage examples.

## NumPy Random

### Random Intro

In this section, you will learn about random number generation in NumPy. It covers generating random numbers, setting random seed, and using different random number generators.

### Data Distribution

This section explores various data distribution functions available in NumPy. It includes examples of generating random numbers from different distributions, such as the normal distribution, binomial distribution, poisson distribution, etc.

### Random Permutation

This section focuses on random permutation and shuffling of arrays in NumPy. It demonstrates how to randomly reorder elements in an array using the `numpy.random.shuffle()` function.

## Seaborn Module

This section introduces the Seaborn module, which is a data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides examples of creating visualizations using Seaborn and utilizing its functionality in conjunction with NumPy arrays.

## Distributions

This section covers various probability distributions commonly used in statistics and data science. Each distribution is explained briefly, along with examples of generating random numbers from that distribution using NumPy.

### Normal Distribution

The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a continuous probability distribution. This section explains the properties of the normal distribution and demonstrates how to generate random numbers from it using NumPy.

### Binomial Distribution

The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. This section explains the binomial distribution and provides examples of generating random numbers from it using NumPy.

### Poisson Distribution

The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. This section explains the Poisson distribution and demonstrates how to generate random numbers from it using NumPy.

### Uniform Distribution

The uniform distribution is a continuous probability distribution where all outcomes are equally likely. This section explains the uniform distribution and provides examples of generating random numbers from it using NumPy.

### Logistic Distribution

The logistic distribution is a continuous probability distribution that resembles the normal distribution but has heavier tails. This section explains the logistic distribution and demonstrates how to generate random numbers from it using NumPy.

### Multinomial Distribution

The multinomial distribution is a generalization of the binomial distribution to multiple categories or outcomes. This section explains the multinomial distribution and provides examples of generating random numbers from it using NumPy.

### Exponential Distribution

The exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution that models the time between events in a Poisson process. This section explains the exponential distribution and demonstrates how to generate random numbers from it using NumPy.

### Chi Square Distribution

The chi-square distribution is a continuous probability distribution that arises in the context of chi-square tests. This section explains the chi-square distribution and provides examples of generating random numbers from it using NumPy.

### Rayleigh Distribution

The Rayleigh distribution is a continuous probability distribution that models the magnitude of a two-dimensional vector whose components are independent and normally distributed. This section explains the Rayleigh distribution and demonstrates how to generate random numbers from it using NumPy.

### Pareto Distribution

The Pareto distribution is a continuous probability distribution that models the distribution of wealth, income, or other quantities exhibiting a power-law tail. This section explains the Pareto distribution and provides examples of generating random numbers from it using NumPy.

### Zipf Distribution

The Zipf distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the frequency of occurrence of different elements in a dataset. This section explains the Zipf distribution and demonstrates how to generate random numbers from it using NumPy.
